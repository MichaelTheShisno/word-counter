Democracy, in principle, is a pure form of government in which the people of a nation govern themselves. However, as Prof Joe Forewaker argues, this is not the case in reality. In democratic societies today, democracy does not exist in pure form, rather it exists as something called “Polity”. 
Professor Forewaker describes “Polity” as a combination of oligarchical and democratic elements. Polity has three main reasons for its existence which include the development of capitalism, growth of power of a state over its citizens, and lastly, the fact that there are more democratic states. 
Forewaker uses Latin American countries as an example of polity in real world. He argues that the democracies of Latin America serve the purpose of satisfying the oligarchies that are in constant competition with one another. In the case of latin American countries, the oligarchies that he refers to are the drug cartels which those governments answer to and satisfy. 
In addition, Forewaker describes polity in the context of the United States. He cites the increasing divide between the rich and poor largely due to private interests and deregulation having more control than the republic itself. Lobbyists have poured hundreds of billions into lobbying so that the interests of the powerful few are served over the interests of the many.
Personally, I see how the theory of polity is seen in modern democracies. I understand that the top 1% of income earners in the U.S. have the ability to have their own interests served above all else's because they have the money and connections to do so. In all, there can never be a truly democratic state as democracy itself serves to quell the tensions between the oligarchies themselves within a nation state.
